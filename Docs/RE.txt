#README:
#Regular patterns are expressed in such a way that they are unix compatible
#When in doubt, try to grep with these patterns via -P
#to be separated with the -=- sign, this is unique enough that java token patterns likely wouldnt include them
#
UNICODE -=- \u[a-fA-F0-9]{4}
#Technically this should be CR (\r), LF (\n), or Both (\r\n)
#Consider commenting this out and just creating the NFA manually
LINE_TERMINATOR -=- $
